# mac-setup

```shell

```

Script for easier setup of a new mac as your dev machine. This script is based on https://github.com/thomaspoignant/mac-dev-setup which I've adjusted for my needs. It's supposed to run on a fresh MacOS machine and will install the following software:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Terminal & command line helpers

  - zsh/[oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) - delightful community-driven (with 1500+ contributors) framework for managing your zsh configuration
  - [ack](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3/) - designed as a replacement for 99% of the uses of grep
  - [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) - programmable completion functions for bash
  - [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd) - next gen ls command

## Manual steps after running the setup scripts

## How can I contribute?

This is mostly meant as my personal setup script and as inspiration for your own, so copy/paste it into your own repo to make the adjustments you want for your setup. If you find actual issues or potential improvements with this repo though, definitely feel free to open an issue or a pull request ðŸ¤“
